            <div class="card-text">
              <p>I am launching an ongoing project to measure the effectiveness of various methods for improving indoor air quality. This new project builds on earlier work done to <a href="https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2019/11/20/data-are-shiftpods-actually-cooler/" target="_blank">measure the effectiveness</a> of expensive Shiftpod tents versus cheap alternatives.</p>
              <p>There are two major goals for this project. First, I will be testing the effectiveness of a very affordable and unusual method of indoor air filtration. As someone with severe asthma during a respiratory pandemic, this is a particularly salient issue for me personally, and I did some personal experiments with filtration methods last year which I'm hoping to build on with this new work.</p>
              <p>Second, I will be testing the effectiveness of houseplants on indoor air quality related to smoke from wildfires. This research builds on earlier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Clean_Air_Study" target="_blank">work from NASA</a> which showed that plants have enormous potential for improving indoor air quality, but did not measure their effectiveness against wildfires specifically.</p>

            <div class="card-text">

              <p>I decided to perform a regression analysis and forecast based on the first six months of coronavirus data to see what it would say about the future. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/djcj88/posts/10163934112880722" target="_blank">The results were fairly terrifying</a>. The analysis shows that it will take four more years plus twenty-million deaths just in Aemrica before the pandemic ends, unless things change between now and then.</a>
              <p>This data inspired me to build a new tool which performs this regression analysis and forecast on a daily basis, with a moving projected end date and death toll.</p>
              <p>Stay tuned, this should be posted later this week.</p>

              <p>I also built a web platform for tracking the progress of the covid-19 pandemic around the world. It shows graphs for major metrics including both linear and logarithmic scaling. I also included sub pages for each country as breakouts. Details are included about how it fethces the data automatically every hour from the UN/ Johns Hopkins.</p>

            <div class="card-text">
              <p>One of my greatest long-term aspirations is to open a venture capital firm dedicated to ethics, justice, and sustainability. I like the phrase "Community Capital" which seems to convey these points while also conveying a dedication to both crowd funding and crowd sourcing.</p>
              <p>There are many examples today from Kapor Capital to Vanguard's ESGV ETF. There is a new perspective developing at the intersection of business and sociology which argues that sustainable and ethical business practices are better investments. In the case of the Vanguard ESGV ETF, their portfolio focuses on companies which value best practices in environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG).</p>
              <p>This is a good example where the argument ESG is making is that these ESG-conscious companies will outperform other companies. In fact, ESGV beats the S&P historically. Beating the S&P has long been believed impossible; this is the holy grail in investment. The fact that ESGV beats the S&P seems to validate this concept.</p>
              <p>I plan to eventually start a VC firm which focuses on ESG investments and helps companies develop into better ESG citizens. Putting out information about this topic will also be an excellent way to lead social change while drawing in further investment.</p>

            <div class="card-text">
              <p>I am developing a housing project with several partners. The basic idea is low-cost, fully modular, and mass-produced housing units. These units can be stacked a dozen high or more. This would finally allow safe, rapid deployment of high-density, low-cost housing.</p>
              <p>We would be a one-stop shop like solar city; customers would just call us and we would manufacture, deliver, and install as many housing units as they would like.</p>
              <p>A nonprofit or foundation branch would buy, install, and manage large projects consisting of these units. This takes the profit motive out of property development and allows development to be driven by more ethical decision making processes versus the current system.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">CRM</h5>
            <div class="card-text">
              <!--
              <p>I have spent most of the last six years developing CRM products for Field Srevices companies. Initially -- until about two years ago -- I had a partner and a large team working on a custom field-services customer relationship management (FS-CRM) project called <a href="http://f2.tech2u.com">F2</a>.</p>
              <p>My vision was (and is) to eventually develop a widely accessible product as a next step after the early F2 work. This eventual project would empower lots of field services companies of all shapes and sizes to implement FS-CRM and reap the incredible benefits of marketing automation, audit automation, business analytics, and many other adjacent tools. I strongly believe that CRM is a solved problem which should be accessible to everyone who can access the internet. The market is currently stuck with low-quality Outlook-style CRM products. The market wants Gmail-style CRM products.</p>
              <p>Several years into building F2 as a precursor to an eventual mass market product, it became clear that my partner and i had different long-term visions. They were only interested in building a high-dollar product to sell to a small number of customers. We decided to part ways amicably in order to work on our separate visions.</p>
              <p>My initial plan for funding the business was to include marketing automation for free with the platform and charge customers a percentage of sales from new revenue we bring them with marketing automation. I tested this with early partners and it worked well, but there was a problem with this model. The work we are doing for all customers is high, while the revenue we get is high for only a few customers. In many cases, it's not clear that we would earn any revenue at all from customers.</p>
              <p>I have come to see this project as funded more like Gmail; Ad-Supported (AS-[FS-CRM]) with an option to pay and remove ads. Ads are not fun for the customer experience, but ads make it possible for lots of people to get free access to these valuable tools. If people want to pay a small fee to remove the ads, that's great. The advantage here is that we are never losing money on any customers. This model will likely evolve in the future, but for now, I think this is the right strategy.</p>
              -->
              <p>I have been developing CRM products with partners and on my own for over a decade. I plan to launch a free ad-supported version for public use sometime in the next several years.</p>

              <p>I had asked several professors about which populations are the most impacted at Sierra College or which groups have the lowest success metrics compared to the average.

I also built a blog for the strategic partnership to use as a central place to document and chronicle all the activity.</p>
