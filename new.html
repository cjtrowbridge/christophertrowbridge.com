                <p>I'm a senior at SFSU studying Urban Studies with minors in Race and Resistance Studies and Queer Ethnic Studies. I'm focusing on sustainable urban infrastructure, particularly in experimental and improvised communities.</p>
                <p>I currently work in disaster response, providing critical infrastructure to communities in need. I also moonlight as an educator helping communities develop their sustainable infrastructure and subsistence farming techniques.</p>
                <p>I plan to expand this work after I graduate, helping communities build the housing, food, and other infrastructure they need to survive and thrive in a changing world.</p>

                <p>One of my greatest long-term aspirations is to open a venture capital firm dedicated to ethics, justice, and sustainability. I like the phrase "Community Capital" which seems to convey these points while also conveying a dedication to both crowd funding and crowd sourcing.</p>
                <p>There are many examples of socially conscious VC funds, but none that I know of is also focused on sustainability. There is a new perspective developing at the intersection of business and sociology which argues that sustainable and ethical business practices are better investments.</p>
                <p>In the case of the Vanguard ESGV ETF, their portfolio focuses on companies which value best practices in environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG). This is a good example where the argument ESG is making is that these ESG-conscious companies will outperform other companies.</p>
                <p>I plan to eventually start a VC firm which focuses on ESG investments and helps companies develop into better ESG citizens. Putting out information about this topic will also be an excellent way to lead social change while drawing in further investment.</p>

I plan to open a new cafe in the bay area which focuses primarily on RTD&E price-accessibility and providing food for a diverse array of cultural needs.</p>

                <p>I recently spent several weeks in the desolation wilderness (what an appropriate name) and I developed a manifesto combining intentional community, permaculture, and arcology with the goal of creating communities designed to survive and thrive during the ongoing collapse of the biosphere.</p>
                <p>The world is turning into a desert. Studies project that most of the US will be desert within the next few decades. I <a href="https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/09/15/desert-farming-is-better/">embrace the desert</a> and xericulture or agriculture designed for deserts. If the world is turning into a desert, then learning to embrace self-sufficience in the desert now will give communities an advantage during the difficult times on the horizon. I argue that there are actually <a href="https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/09/30/desert-advantages/">advantages</a> in terms of self-sufficiency for communities in the desert.</p>

              <div class="card-text">
                <!--
                <p>I have spent most of the last six years developing CRM products for Field Services companies. Initially -- until about two years ago -- I had a partner and a large team working on a custom field-services customer relationship management (FS-CRM) project called <a href="http://f2.tech2u.com">F2</a>.</p>
                <p>My vision was (and is) to eventually develop a widely accessible product as a next step after the early F2 work. This eventual project would empower lots of field services companies of all shapes and sizes to implement FS-CRM and reap the incredible benefits of marketing automation, audit automation, business analytics, and many other adjacent tools. I strongly believe that CRM is a solved problem which should be accessible to everyone who can access the internet. The market is currently stuck with low-quality Outlook-style CRM products. The market wants Gmail-style CRM products.</p>
                <p>Several years into building F2 as a precursor to an eventual mass market product, it became clear that my partner and i had different long-term visions. They were only interested in building a high-dollar product to sell to a small number of customers. We decided to part ways amicably in order to work on our separate visions.</p>
                <p>My initial plan for funding the business was to include marketing automation for free with the platform and charge customers a percentage of sales from new revenue we bring them with marketing automation. I tested this with early partners and it worked well, but there was a problem with this model. The work we are doing for all customers is high, while the revenue we get is high for only a few customers. In many cases, it's not clear that we would earn any revenue at all from customers.</p>
                <p>I have come to see this project as funded more like Gmail; Ad-Supported (AS-[FS-CRM]) with an option to pay and remove ads. Ads are not fun for the customer experience, but ads make it possible for lots of people to get free access to these valuable tools. If people want to pay a small fee to remove the ads, that's great. The advantage here is that we are never losing money on any customers. This model will likely evolve in the future, but for now, I think this is the right strategy.</p>
                -->
                <p>I have been developing CRM products with partners and on my own for over a decade. I plan to launch a free ad-supported version for public use sometime in the next several years.</p>
