                  <li>Each group offered a food item for free to marginalized members of that group.</li>
                  <li>Privileged members were invited to pay for the item.</li>
                  <li>My table had coffee; this was free except for straight people who were invited to pay.</li>
                  <li>This simple event effectively communicated the extreme complexity of what duties people still have dispite also having marginalized identities. For example, gay men are still men and therefore benefit from sexism despite being marginalized on the basis of identity. So they get free coffee from the sexuality table but pay for lemon bars at the gender table.</li>
